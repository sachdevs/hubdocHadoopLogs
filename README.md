# hubdocHadoopLogs
Prototype for FluentD pushing logs into HDFS for archiving and running batch jobs

Ansible scripts for deploying are included

Will publish hadoop ansible role for setting up pseudo distributed hadoop for prototyping/testing (couldnt find one that exists, all ansible hadoop scripts seem to be doing too many extra things)
